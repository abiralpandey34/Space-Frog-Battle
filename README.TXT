I developed this game to refine my pre-existing knowlege of Object Oriented Programming. 

This game was developed using Greenfoot which is an integrated development environment that is supposed to hide nitty gritty details of JAVA and lets a programmer focus on the code itself. As expected, this project really helped me to understand ins and outs of the OOP concept. This is why i wanted to share this project to the community.

THe game itself is really simple. It has a main character frog that eats mushroom as a food. Meanwhile an alien follows the frog to kill it so user has to evade alien while eating the food. The time counter & food counter keeps track of time left and food score respectively. 

The controls to move the frog is W-A-S-D or Up-Right-Down-Left arrow. The game is over when frog eats all the mushroom or alien touches the frog.
